# This logic comes from an old version of zim. Essentially, bracketed-paste was
# added as a requirement of url-quote-magic in 5.1, but in 5.1.1 bracketed
# paste had a regression. Additionally, 5.2 added bracketed-paste-url-magic
# which is generally better than url-quote-magic so we load that when possible.
